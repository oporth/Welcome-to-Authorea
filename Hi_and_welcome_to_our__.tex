Hi and welcome to our collaborative book chapter!  

The idea is to use this website to work on the document using \LaTeX.  \textbf{Bold text}, equations: $a^2+b^2=c^2$ just work as usual.  

To start editing a section, hover over it and click on the ``Edit'' link.  This opens a text-box where you can do your editing.  Click ``Save and Close'' when you are done...

I am not so sure about the citations yet.  Perhaps best each one of us uploads his own .bib file (in the bibliography subfolder in the ``Folder view''), we include all of them and at the very end we just remove the duplications.  
I just dropped my file oliver.bib, now let me try this: \cite{buehler2012}.\\
Cute, it just works.  

You can click the ``Export document'' button above to download everything to your harddrive.  

If you find this way of working annoying, just mail your text to Oliver, Rolf or Astrid(?) and we will take care of it.  

Now, about the contents:  
Below, I pasted the last outline we have from the 20.11.  This is not carved in stone so we can certainly discuss this further.  However, I suggest we start generating text fitting to these headings and then re-arrange if required.  

Wishing us happy writing...
