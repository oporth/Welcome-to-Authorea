Hi and welcome to our collaborative book chapter!  

The idea is to use this website to work on the document using \LaTeX.  \textbf{Bold text}, equations: $a^2+b^2=c^2$ just work as usual.  

To start editing a section, hover over it and click on the ``Edit'' link.  This opens a text-box where you can do your editing.  Click ``Save and Close'' when you are done...

I am not so sure about the citations yet.  Perhaps best each one of us uploads his own .bib file (in the folder section), we include all of them and at the very end we just remove the duplications.  
Let me try this: \cite{buehler2012}

If you find this way of working annoying, just mail your text to Oliver, Rolf or Astrid(?) and we will take care of it.
