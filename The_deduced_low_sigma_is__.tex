The deduced low $\sigma$ is in contrast with the theoretical expectation of high $\sigma$ in pulsar winds. This conflict can be settled if the knot is produced by the striped equatorial section of the wind. In the striped section, $\sigma$ can be reduced via
magnetic dissipation of the stripes either in the wind or inside the hybrid MHD shock which terminates it, with the post-shock flow dynamics being identical for the alternatives.
