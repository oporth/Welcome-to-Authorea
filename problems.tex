Over the past two decades, modelling of PWN has lead to a good understanding of the plasma flow in these systems. Predominantly studies have focused on the Crab nebula.  The global plasma flow and dynamics in this system are well described by the simulations. The origin of its jet, the torus, the inner knot and the wisps are understood. However, other features as the knots of the inner ring or the ``thin wisp'' \cite{Hester_1995} are not present in the simulations. Also, the morphology of other PWN appears to be more complex. In the Vela PWN for instance, the receeding jet is brighter than the one pointed to the observer, at odds with the expectation of Doppler beaming in plasma flow models.

Recently, an important step forward was done by simulating the Crab nebula in 3D. The 3D randomisation of the magnetic field leads to magnetic dissipation inside the PWN. This removes the constraint of low magnetization of the pulsar wind imposed by 1D and 2D axisymmetric models and is likely the solution to the longstanding ``sigma problem''. As always, a deeper understanding comes with many new questions. Also, several older questions remain unanswered. We will summarize the ones we consider most important in the following: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Where and how does non-thermal particle acceleration take place? How does the particle spectrum evolve in the nebula, particularly along the termination shock? }

Magnetic reconnection appears to be the main process by which particles are accelerated in the nebula. It remains unclear where and how this happens. In particular it is unclear if different acceleration mechanisms take place at different latitudes along the termination shock and what the contribution of second order Fermi acceleration within the body of the nebula is.

\item \textbf{What is the effect of the feedback of the acceleration on the plasma flow?}

As a significant fraction of the total energy goes into accelerating particles, their back reaction on the plasma could be important. To date, only test particle simulations have been performed, neglecting the feedback of the accelerated particles on the global plasma flow. The simple ideal MHD approximations will need to be extended to a more realistic plasma description.

\item \textbf{Where within the nebulae do the gamma-ray flares originate? Are these exceptional events with little impact on the overall evolution/emission of PWN or a high-energy tail of the main dissipative processes?  }

Significant progress has been made in understanding the processes that can lead to explosive gamma-ray flares. However, if and where within the nebula these processes happen remains unclear. It is puzzling that no gamma-ray flares have been discovered from any other isolated PWN than the Crab nebula. It is not clear if similar processes are responsible for Crab nebula flares and the flares of the binary PSR B1259-63.

\item \textbf{What is the origin of radio electrons? Are they supplied by the pulsar wind and if not then why does the spectrum of emission not show a discontinuity between the radio and optical parts? }

The hard energy spectrum of the radio emitting electrons suggests that they are accelerated via magnetic reconnection. However, where these electrons come from remains an open question. If the electrons are provided by the wind their large number is in conflict with magnetospheric models. An alternative is that electrons are stripped from the gas and dust in the Nebula's filaments. In this case, however, spectral continuity with the higher energy particle population would be a mystery, and just as mysterious would be the similarity between the radio spectra of PWN and those of Bow Shock PWN, where there are no filaments from which low energy particles could come.

\item \textbf{What is the structure of termination shock in the polar region? }

In the polar region the pulsar wind has no stripes and hence a very high magnetization is expected both upstream and downstream of the termination shock. It is unclear what the fate of the highly magnetized flow injected into the nebula in this region is and if its magnetic energy can be dissipated on a light-crossing time.

\item \textbf{How many electrons/positron escape into the ISM, and with which energies? Can PWN potentially explain the positron excess?}

The interaction of PWN with the surrounding medium is complex, as they evolve within the remnant of their progenitors explosions. It is unclear how many electrons can escape the magnetic confinement of these systems and if their number is sufficient to explain the positron excess observed at Earth. Of course, if the radio emitting particles, which are the relevant ones for this matter, come from filaments, and are therefore all electrons (no positrons), then PWN cannot contribute to the positron excess. 

\item \textbf{Is an energetically significant amount of non-thermal ions present in PWN?}

To date, no observational signature of ions has been found in PWN. However, due to their low radiation efficiency, there could still be an energetically significant number of ions present in the pulsar wind.

\end{enumerate}

The search for answers of these questions is ongoing. Fortunately, deeper observations and increasingly realistic simulations are powerful tools at our disposal in this quest.
