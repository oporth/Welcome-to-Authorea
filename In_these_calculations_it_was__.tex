In these calculations, it was assumed that the spectrum of the knot emission is a power law. This implies that the termination shock is an efficient accelerator of non-thermal particles. Although this assumption is a corner stone of the popular and successful model for the Crab Nebula emission by \citet{kc84b}, its validity have been questioned by the PIC simulations of shocks in striped flow \citep{SS-11}. They suggest that the non-thermal particles acceleration can only be efficient in small equatorial sector where the downstream plasma becomes almost unmagnetised.  Otherwise, the plasma is simply heated and its synchrotron emission must have thermal spectrum.  Interestingly, the current failure to detect both the radio and X-ray emission from the knot  is consistent with such a spectrum.
