In these calculations, it was assumed that the spectrum of the knot emission is a power law. This implies that the termination shock is an efficient accelerator of non-thermal particles. Although this assumption is a corner stone of the popular and successful model for the Crab Nebula emission by \citet{kc84b}, its validity has been questioned by the PIC simulations of shocks in striped flow \citep{SS-11}. These suggest that the non-thermal particle acceleration can only be efficient in a small equatorial sector where the downstream plasma becomes almost unmagnetised.  Otherwise, the plasma is simply heated and its synchrotron emission has a thermal spectrum.  Interestingly, the current failure to detect both the radio and X-ray emission from the knot  is consistent with such a spectrum.
