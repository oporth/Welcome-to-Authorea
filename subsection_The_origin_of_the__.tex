\subsection{The origin of the gamma-ray flares}

The Crab nebula flares pose severe challenges to models of particle acceleration. It is usually assumed that the flare emission originated from synchrotron radiation of freshly accelerated electron. The reason is that the high gamma-ray energy of the flares ($\approx 1$~GeV) implies the presence of electrons with multi PeV energies for typical magentic fields of $B \approx 200 \mu$G expected in the nebula. The cooling time of these particles is $\tau_{cool} \lesim 20$ days. The emission region can therefore not be far from the acceleration site (however, other views exist as we will discuss further on). Assuming the acceleration and radiation region are the same, the high luminositiy of the flares poses severe constraints of the acceleration efficiency during the flares: The total isotropic fluence during the brightest flares is $\epsilon \approx L_{\gamma,iso} \times t_{var} \approx $ ergs s$^{-1}$. Causality implies that the emission region has a volume $\approc (c t_{var})^3$. The magnetic energy in such a region us . In order to have enough magnetic energy in this region to provide just the emitted gamma-ray energy, the magnetic field needs to be . The RMHD simulations discussed in section show that such fields are unrealistic anywhere within the body of the nebula.
