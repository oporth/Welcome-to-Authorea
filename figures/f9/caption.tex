\label{thickness-effect}{The top panels show the knot images resulting from emitting region of thickness equal to 0.1 (left) and 0.2 (right) of the local shock radius. The bottom panels illustrate the emissivity models used for these calculations. The dotted line shows the termination shock surface, the dashed line shows the line of sight and the mono-coloured image shows the corresponding volume emissivity distribution.
