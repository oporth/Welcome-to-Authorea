\label{fig:knot}
Optical image of the Crab nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. The image is 0.02$^\circ$ on each side. Different structures of the nebula are indicated. Particularly, the ''inner knot´´ can be seen, it is located $\approx 0.6$ arc sec away from the pulsar \cite{rudy2015}.  The most dynamic feature, the ``Sprite'' \citep[e.g.][]{hester2002} is shown at the base of the jet.
