In this sketch, we show Doppler beams at two locations on the
termination shock, selected by the lines of sight originated at the pulsar and at
the brightness peak of the knot, where the post-shock velocity is parallel to the
line of sight. In order for the knot not to extend all the way to the pulsar in the
plane of the sky, the Doppler beam at the first location should point away from
the observer and hence $\alpha_d<\Delta\delta$.
