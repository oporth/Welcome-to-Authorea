Rendering of magnetic field lines in 3D simulations of PWN.  Color indicates $B_\phi/B_{p}$: in the innermost regions, toroidal field (red) is injected which randomises further out and develops a poloidal component (blue).  The kink instability of the leads to the corkscrew morphology of the inner jet.
