Plot of the flow structure, with colors indicating the velocity magnitude in terms of $c$ and arrows the velocity field direction. The TS front is highlighted by the blue contour line of $0.99c$. Sectors corresponding to case (2) (polar) and case (3) (equatorial) are represented, respectively, by the green and red cones. \label{fig:ts}
