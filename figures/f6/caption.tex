\label{knot-mhd-model}{In this sketch, we show the plane defined by the rotational axis of the pulsar and the location of fiducial  observer.  The region around the pulsar corresponds to the un-shocked  pulsar wind, the continuous lines show the wind termination shock, indicating its topological components, the Mach belt, arch and rim shocks. The blue shaded region shows the region there the shocked wind plasma flows towards the observer with moderately relativistic speed. The dashed lines are the lines of sight, which show the order in which the jet the knot and the pulsar appear in the plane of the sky of the observer.
