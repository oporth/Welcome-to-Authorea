The upper panels shows the daily averaged gamma-ray flux above 100 MeV from the direction of the Crab nebula measured by the Fermi-LAT (from the monitored source list). The lower panels show the times at which instruments at other wavebands observed the source (In total >650 ks of Chandra and >350 ks of HST data).\label{fig:lc}
