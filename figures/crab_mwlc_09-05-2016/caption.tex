The black markers show the daily averaged gamma-ray flux above 100 MeV from the direction of the Crab nebula measured by the Fermi-LAT. This data is routinely updated and publicly available at \url{http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/msl_lc/}. Colored markers indicate the times at which instruments at other wavebands observed the source (see text).\label{fig:lc}
