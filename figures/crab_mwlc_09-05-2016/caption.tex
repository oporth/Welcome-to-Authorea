The upper panels shows the daily averaged gamma-ray flux above 100 MeV from the direction of the Crab nebula measured by the Fermi-LAT (This data is routinely updated and publicly available at \url{http:\/\/fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov\/ssc\/data\/access\/lat\/msl\_lc\/}). The lower panels show the times at which instruments at other wavebands observed the source (see text).\label{fig:lc}
