The upper panels shows the daily averaged gamma-ray flux above 100 MeV from the direction of the Crab nebula measured by the Fermi-LAT \footnote{This data is routinly updated and publicly available at http:\/\/fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov\/ssc\/data\/access\/lat\/msl\_lc\/}. The lower panels show the times at which instruments at other wavebands observed the source (see text).\label{fig:lc}
