\label{fig:rmhdflow} Zoomed in view on the termination shock (red contour) showing the logarithm of the magnetization.  Parameters of the simulation are:  $\sigma_0=1$, $\alpha=45^\circ$. In-plane streamlines (white contours) get deflected at the shock and turn towards the equator or polar axis, depending on the magnetization.  Note that the magnetization in the nebula can be significantly higher by a factor $\sim10$ than the one injected with the wind.
