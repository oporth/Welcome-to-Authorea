The top panels show the knot images resulting from emitting region
of thickness equal to 0.1 (left) and 0.2 (right) of the local shock radius. The
bottom panels illustrate the corresponding emissivity models in the plane containing the observer and the axis of symmetry. The
dotted line shows the termination shock surface, the dashed line shows the line of
sight and the mono-coloured image shows the corresponding volume emissivity
distribution.
