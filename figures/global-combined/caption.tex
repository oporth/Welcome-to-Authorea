Global views of the nebula showing magnetic field strength (left) and total pressure in the nebula (right).  There is a significant range in magnetic field strength, with $|B|\approx1\rm m\, Gauss$ near the TS and a volume-average of $\approx 100\, \mu\rm Gauss$.  Apart from the hotspot in the dissipation region of the polar beam, the total pressure is close to uniform in the nebula.
