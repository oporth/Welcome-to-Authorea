\label{fig:knotcorr}
Correlation between parameters of the inner knot as a function of its distance from the Crab pulsar. Right: size of the knot perpendicular to the pulsar-knot axis, Middle: size of the knot along the pulsar-knot axis, Right: k-band flux of the knot normalized to the pulsar flux.
