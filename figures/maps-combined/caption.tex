Synthetic emission maps assuming energy of the non-thermal particles scales as  $\epsilon\propto p$  i.e. assuming only adiabatic effects.  Two simulations are compared: $\sigma_0=3,\alpha=10^\circ$ (left) and $\sigma_0=1,\alpha=45^\circ$ (right).  In high-magnetisation, low obliqueness models, the torus and wisp regions are under-luminous and the emission from the jet (in fact the polar beam) dominates.  Morphology and parameters of the right-hand model fit well to the optical images of the Crab PWN.  Blue color indicates where pixels were saturated ($80\%$ peak intensity) in order to better show faint features.
