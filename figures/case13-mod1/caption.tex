Radial positions of the local intensity maxima (in arcseconds) as a function of time (in months) with orange diamonds identifying radio wisps ($\nu_r=5$ GHz), green crosses optical ones ($\nu_o=3.75 \times 10^{14}$ Hz) and light-blue circles for X-rays (1 keV). 
On the left case (1) is shown. On the right case (3) is shown, with X-ray particles injected in the equatorial zone and radio ones injected in the complementary sector.
