\label{knot-separation}  {In this sketch, we show Doppler beams at two locations on the termination shock, selected by the lines of sight originated at the pulsar and  at the brightness peak of the knot, where the post-shock velocity is parallel to the line of sight.  
In order for the knot not to extend all the to the pulsar in the plane of the sky,  the Doppler beam at the first location should point away from the observer and hence $\alpha_d < \Delta\delta$.
